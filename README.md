# Requirements
1. You must submit a working version of a Jokes app that meets navigational expectations.
2. All warnings and errors in the app must be addressed before submission (including all XML warnings); if any warnings are not addressed you must acknowledge this in your README.md file.
3. The app must conform to the MVP design pattern.
4. You must include some starter data in the app that includes at least four jokes (you may use the one I've provided as one of your four). Note that you need not use Room or an actual database - the goal here is that you produce an MVP compliant app, so a database is not necessary.
5. You must add one unique feature to the app that makes it your own. This feature need not be highly complex, but should be code-based (i.e. not exclusively UI).
6. You must include a well-written and well-formatted README.md file that clearly outlines all changes that you've made and identifies any requirements that you did not address. If you are not able to produce a working version of the app, you should explain why in your README.md.
